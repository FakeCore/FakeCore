## Installation

Until 2022-09-06, both failed after trying to use Bash and Cargo to create an app. I recommend using Yarn to create the app.

```bash
yarn create tauri-app
```

choose your package manager

choose yarn

choose your front-end stack.

After finishing filling out the options, you can start the app with the command

```bash
yarn tauri dev
```
